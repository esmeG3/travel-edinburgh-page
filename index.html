        <h3>Why visit <em>"Auld Reekie"</em>?</h3>
        <p>
     Fondly known as <em>“Auld Reekie,”</em> which means <em>“Old Smokey”</em> in Scots.
Edinburgh's stunning cityscape is one of dramatic contrasts.
From the refined elegance of the New Town to the Old Town's tangled web of medieval streets, these two complementary parts of the city offer visitors an ever-changing perspective alongside countless fascinating historical and cultural attractions.
        </p>
        <p>
Scotland’s capital is one of the most unique and memorable cities in Europe. 
Edinburgh has a rare charm with narrow and cobbled passageways. 
The town is also known for its dark corners where terrifying events have taken place, its majestic buildings and gardens, countless fascinating museums, which are free to visit, and, especially, the city's kind and open locals. All the above-mentioned make this city a favorite among those who have seen it.

                My name is Esme. I have built this website as part of a project to display my coding skills. 
                The first time I visited Edinburgh was in 2019, and I fell in love with the city. I am planning a second visit for my birthday.
